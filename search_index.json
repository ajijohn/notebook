["index.html", "PhD. Notebook Chapter 1 Preamble 1.1 Published papers", " PhD. Notebook Aji John 2018-03-27 Chapter 1 Preamble I am a PhD student in Biology at University of Washington. I’m intersted in boundary layer climate, and the effects of microclimates(think of climate right above ground) on plants and animals. I like to develop computational tools in R and Python. I embrace openness in research and believe in sharing knowledge. Below are the packages developed in R that could be used in any field. The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: # TrenchR # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. Few sites where my research can be visualized. Extract microclimate data at http://microclim.org/. 1.1 Published papers Ausmees, Kristiina, and Pushpam Aji John. “Analysis of Chromosome 20-A Study.” arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.00276 (2016).
